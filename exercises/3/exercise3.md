# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance

## Exercise 3

For this assignment, you and a partner will write a systems-level, automated black-box tests for the Reddit website using the Katalon Automation Recorder.  Specifically, we are going to test the r/cats subreddit at:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/

It was chosen because it is a nice safe subreddit which is policed pretty well.  Besides, it's cats.

This is a Rails application written by me for Ruby compilation analysis so that I could improve performance in a Ruby app.  The code is located here: https://github.com/laboon/hoodpopper The tests you write can be black-box tests; you should not need to look at this code unless you're interested.  If you'd prefer to do some grey-box testing, feel free to check out the code, but once again, it is not necessary.

I recommend you do a minimum of six tests, one for each requirement listed in requirements.md.  

## Ruby Basics


You should focus only on basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /), variables, and printing for this exercise, e.g.:


Based on these and any other issues or expected behavior you may discover, you should write approximately eight test cases and save them.

## Submission

There is no submission for this exercise.  Please practice until you have gained confidence.
